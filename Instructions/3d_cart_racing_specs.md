## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

### 3.1. Core Racing Mechanics

- **Controls**:
  - Accelerate: W / Up Arrow / Right Trigger
  - Brake/Reverse: S / Down Arrow / Left Trigger
  - Steer: A/D / Left/Right Arrows / Left Analog Stick
  - Drift: Hold Shift / Right Bumper (initiates drift for sharp turns, builds boost)
  - Use Power-Up: Spacebar / A Button
  - Jump: Ctrl / X Button (for small hops over obstacles or ramps)
- **Drifting**:
  - Drifting around corners builds a boost meter
  - Release drift to activate boost (temporary speed increase)
  - Visual feedback: Sparks and tire smoke during drift
- **Boost System**:
  - Earn boosts via drifting, collecting boost pads on track, or power-ups
  - Boost duration: 2-3 seconds, with a 1.5x speed multiplier
- **Collisions**:
  - Cart-to-cart collisions cause minor speed loss and directional push
  - Collisions with walls or obstacles cause a brief spin-out (1-2 seconds)
- **Laps and Checkpoints**:
  - Each track has 3 laps by default
  - Checkpoints prevent shortcuts and reset players if they go off-track
- **AI Opponents**:
  - 6-8 AI opponents in single-player modes
  - AI difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
  - AI uses same power-ups and mechanics as players, with adaptive pathfinding

### 3.2. Power-Ups

- **Spawning**: Power-ups appear in item boxes placed strategically on tracks
- **Types**:
  - Speed Boost: Immediate speed increase for 3 seconds
  - Missile: Homing projectile that spins out one opponent
  - Shield: Protects from one power-up hit or collision (lasts 10 seconds)
  - Oil Slick: Drops a slippery patch behind the cart, causing spin-outs
  - Turbo Trap: Places a hidden trap on the track that boosts the user but slows others
  - Randomizer: Randomly assigns a power-up effect to all players
- **Balancing**:
  - Players in last place have a higher chance of getting powerful power-ups
  - Power-up effects have cooldowns to prevent spamming (e.g., 5-second delay between missile uses)
- **Visuals**: Each power-up has a distinct 3D model and particle effect

### 3.3. Tracks

- **Number of Tracks**: 12 tracks, divided into 3 themed cups (4 tracks each)
- **Themes**:
  - Tropical Island: Beaches, palm trees, water hazards
  - Urban City: Skyscrapers, tunnels, traffic obstacles
  - Fantasy Kingdom: Castles, lava pits, magical portals
- **Track Features**:
  - Length: 1-2 km per lap
  - Width: Wide enough for 3-4 carts side-by-side
  - Hazards: Moving obstacles (e.g., rolling barrels, swinging pendulums), environmental effects (e.g., rain reducing traction)
  - Shortcuts: Hidden paths or ramps, some requiring boosts or jumps
  - Dynamic Elements: Elevators, drawbridges, or collapsing sections
- **Track Design**:
  - Use modular 3D assets for reusable track components (straights, curves, ramps)
  - Include elevation changes (hills, bridges, tunnels)
  - Ensure clear visual cues for turns and hazards

### 3.4. Carts and Customization

- **Cart Stats**:
  - Speed: Top speed (range: 50-80 km/h)
  - Acceleration: Time to reach top speed (range: 2-5 seconds)
  - Handling: Turning radius and grip (range: low to high)
  - Weight: Affects collision impact and spin-out recovery (light, medium, heavy)
- **Cart Types**:
  - 6 base cart models (e.g., Speedster, Tank, Drifter)
  - Each model has unique stat balance (e.g., Speedster: high speed, low weight)
- **Customization**:
  - Colors: RGB color picker for body, wheels, and accents
  - Decals: 20+ pre-designed stickers (e.g., flames, stars, logos)
  - Accessories: Cosmetic items like spoilers, antennas, or exhaust pipes
  - Unlockables: Earn new carts, decals, and accessories via race wins or challenges
- **Characters**:
  - 8 playable characters with unique animations and voice lines
  - Characters are cosmetic only (no stat impact)
  - Examples: Racer Rex (cool dude), Turbo Tina (energetic kid), Professor Gear (mad scientist)
