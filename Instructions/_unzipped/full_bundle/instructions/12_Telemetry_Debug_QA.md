# 12 — Telemetry, Debug, & QA
## Events
- race_start, lap_complete, item_roll, item_use, hit, offroad, finish_place, coins_awarded, upgrade_purchase, best_lap_update

## Debug Overlays
- Track spline, AI target, checkpoint IDs, DDA current scales

## QA Must-Pass
- No lap-skip with cuts
- Shield absorbs one hit reliably
- DDA bounds within ±6%
- 4P split-screen at 60 FPS on M1 or equivalent
- Pity rule prevents Lightning spam on same player
