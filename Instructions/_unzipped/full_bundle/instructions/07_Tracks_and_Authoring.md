# 07 — Tracks & Authoring
**MVP Tracks:** Sunny Speedway (Beginner, 900 m), Jungle Drift (1050 m), City Circuit (1100 m)

## Rules
- Checkpoints every 80–120 m; must hit last checkpoint before lap counts
- Anti-cut volumes at shortcuts
- Item boxes: 18/20/22 respectively
- Surface types: tarmac, mud, curb, ramp; boost pads placed for flow
- Export: glTF + JSON (spline, checkpoints, surfaces, pads, item positions)

## Themes & Landmarks
- Clear silhouettes; read at speed; avoid visual noise in apex zones
